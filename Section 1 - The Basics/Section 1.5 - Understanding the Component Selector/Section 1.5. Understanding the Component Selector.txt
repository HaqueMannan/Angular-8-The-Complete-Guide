> The @Component Selector meta-tag must be a unique selector so that we do not override an already existing Selector accidentally (whether it is our own component or one provided by an external third party package).
> We do not need to use this type of selector whereby we use a HTML element for the selector e.g:
   <app-servers></app-servers>

> The Selector works like CSS properties and we are not limited to selecting components by elements. The three different methods we can use are:
   - HTML Element:
      .component.ts File
         @Component {
            selector: 'app-server'
         }
      .component.html File
         <app-server></app-server>

   - HTML Attribute (using square brackets):
      .component.ts File
         @Component {
            selector: '[app-server]'
         }
      .component.html File
         <div app-servers></div>

   - HTML Class (using period .):
      .component.ts File
         @Component {
            selector: '.app-server'
         }
      .component.html File
         <div class="app-servers"></div>

> Selecting by id and pseudo selectors do not work with Selectors.
> We Typically would use the element selector for components but there are instances whereby we could use a different selector for our components.
