> Directives are instructions in the DOM.

> Components are directives with templates.

> There are Directives without a template. Below is an example of a custom directive:
   <p appTurnGreen>Receives a green background!</p>

> We typically use the attribute style for directives but we can also configure them as elements or class styles.

> In the above Angular will try to find the instruction for appTurnGreen directive. This instruction would look something like the below:
   @Directive({
      selector: '[appTurnGreen]'
   })
   export class TurnGreenDirective{
      ...
   }

> There are built-in directives we can use as well as build our own directives for our Angular applications.

> The ngIf is a built in directive shipped with Angular and works like the conditional if statement.
   servers.components.html:
      <p *ngIf="serverCreated">Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }}</p>

   server.components.ts:
      export class ServersComponent implements OnInit {
         serverCreated = false;

         onCreateServer() {
            this.serverCreated = true;
         }
      }

> The asterisk (*) is used because the ngIf is a structural directive which means it changes the structure of the DOM. Therefore, it either adds or does not add an element to the DOM.

> the ngIf takes in any expression that returns a boolean true or false value. This could be from a property, external method or an inline method but the value must return a true or false value.

> The ngIf will add or remove the element to or from the DOM and the element is not there at all time i.e. it is not hidden nor is it present.

> There is also an else condition block we can add to our ngIf directive. To achieve this by placing a local reference using the # followed by the local reference name. This will act as a marker for the else clause.
> We would then use the <ng-template> component directive shipping with Angular which allows us to mark places in the DOM using the local reference.
> We can then enhance the ngIf with an else clause followed by the local reference name to add or removed based on the if/else clause.
